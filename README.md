## Demo

## Prerequisites

Any one RaspberryPi device with Python3 support. If you don't know how to configure a headless on your Pi, [this documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-bullseye-update-april-2022/) could help you.

## Installation

Enter via SSH in your RaspberryPi and run the next steps:

Raspberry OS dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install git python3-venv python3-dev libopenjp2-7
```

Python dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.local
~/.local/bin/pip install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306 pyyaml pillow Adafruit_PureIO add_service
```

I2C enable:

```bash
sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0
```

Pilauncher service install:

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/hpsaturn/pilauncher.git
cp -r pilauncher/utils ~/bin
python3 -m add_service "/usr/bin/python3 /home/YOUR_USER/pilauncher/main.py" --user YOUR_USER --name "pilauncher"
```

## First run

You able to launch this like a simple systemd service with:

```bash
sudo service pilauncher start
```

it will be launched after each reboot. You also could run it like a normal python app with `python3 main.py` e.g for debugging your apps. Don't forget stop first the service.

## App Launcher

This service use a simple YAML file to specify what apps will be launched and also its subservices or commands, like a status or information commands. You able to put whatever.

**Example**:

```yaml
WIFI:
  WiFi On:
    cmd: sudo nmcli connection up YOUR_WIFI_CONNECTION
  WiFi Off:
    cmd: sudo nmcli connection down YOUR_WIFI_CONNECTION
  Status:
    cmd: nmcli c show --active | grep wlan0 | awk '{if(/YOUR_WIFI_CONNECTION/) print "connected:",$1}'
  Back:
    cmd: back
```

In the [apps.yml](https://github.com/hpsaturn/pilauncher/blob/master/apps.yml) file you able to put your apps. There you will found more commented examples.

Also please review the wiki page with [full recipes guides](https://github.com/hpsaturn/pilauncher/wiki/Recipes)

**Reservated names**:

`cmd: back` -> it could help to return a previous level when you only have two buttos. For now the launcher only supports two buttons.

`Status:` -> this reservated name uses its `cmd` for refresh the subtitle of App item in the menu.

`Info:` or `Stats:` -> these sub commands could be only for real time information on the screen. You able to specify 1 or many commands. Each command will be the output for each line. For now it only support four lines. For example, we have a application VPN that uses NordVPN CLI. The first subcommand of this app uses `Info:` reservated name, and its lines will be a realtime information of the current status of the VPN.

```yml
VPN:
  Info:
    l1: /home/pi/bin/vpnstatus
    l2: nordvpn status | grep City | awk '{if(/City:/) print "City:",$2}'
    l3: nordvpn status | grep IP | awk '{if(/IP:/) print "IP:",$2}'
    l4: nordvpn status | grep Transfer | awk '{if(/Transfer:/) print $2.$3,"/",$5.$6}'
  Colombia:
    cmd: nordvpn connect Colombia
  Argentina:
    cmd: nordvpn connect Argentina 
  VPN Off:
    cmd: nordvpn disconnect
  Status:
    cmd: /home/pi/bin/vpnstatus
  Back:
    cmd: back
```

## Settings

In the `settings.yml` file you will found some minimal settings for now:

```yaml
auto_screen_off: True     # reduce CPU consumption and increase OLED life
screen_time_off: 60       # time for auto screen off
info_refresh_rate : 3     # real time refresh. Recommended 3 or more
status_refresh_rate : 5   # refresh for the status field of each app
show_stats_on_boot: False # show the info stats of the first app in the boot
```
